# Challenges faced while doing the Project
1) While using async thunk I realised that while calling the function using dispatch hook we cannot pass two argumnet in  the function instead it we can only pass an single argument to solve this i started passing them as object
2) Redirecting to login page if user was not login for example if I directly tried to accessing the user cartPage without loggin in by changing the url directly in searchBar the user should be redirected at login page I soolved this by creating  a protectedRoute page which checks wether the user is logged in or not
3) CRUD opeartion on cart where changing the json database but where not shown in the front end to solve this I first change the data in the databse and send that data to reducers function and then I changed that in selectors also
4) Applying filter property on products was another challenge to after reading the json-server application I came to Know about query string which can be passed on to url as query param  for filtrartion however I am still unable to figureOut how to apply multiple filter


# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
